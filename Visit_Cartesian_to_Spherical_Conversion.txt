necessary for converting mesh coordinates from cartesian to spherical to properly display vector data. 

In order to create these transformations I referenced the following sources:

	[visit-users] forum post: 
	https://elist.ornl.gov/pipermail/visit-users/2015-September/017842.html
	(The user wants polar coordinates, however, the method is very much the same)
	
	Transformation matrix for converting from spherical to cartesian (Under Spherical Coordinate System -> Vector Fields): 
	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_fields_in_cylindrical_and_spherical_coordinates
	This provides the transformation equations for creating Bx, By, and Bz. 



Coords: 
coord(mesh) // defines coordinate mesh as a Vector Mesh Variable

X:
Coords[0] // defines X-direction as Scalar Mesh Variable

Y:
Coords[1] // defines Y-direction as Scalar Mesh Variable

Z:
Coords[2] // defines Z-direction as Scalar Mesh Variable

R:
sqrt(X*X+Y*Y+Z*Z) // defines R, radius, as a Scalar Mesh Variable

theta:
acos(Z/(R+.001)) // defines theta as a Scalar Mesh Variable

phi:
acos(X/(R*sin(theta))) // defines phi as a Scalar Mesh Variable 

Bx:
Mr*sin(theta)*cos(phi)+Mt*cos(theta)*cos(phi)-Mp*sin(phi) // Magnitude of B-field in x-direction

By:
Mr*sin(theta)*sin(phi)+Mt*cos(theta)*sin(phi)+Mp*cos(phi) //  Magnitude of B-field in y-direction

Bz:
Mr*cos(theta)-Mt*sin(theta) // Magnitude of B-field in z-direction

Magnetic_Field:
{Vx,Vy,Vz}  // The magnetic field itself in vector form
